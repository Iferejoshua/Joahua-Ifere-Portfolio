Global CO2 Emissions Project Description
I am so happy to share my first Tableau Project on The Global CO2 emissions.

The dataset source is from OUR WORLD IN DATA on the global CO2 project 
Iâ€™ll be playing the role of a BI Analyst, and I will be performing;

Descriptive analysis
Segmentation analysis
Aggregate analysis.
#share #learning
Here are some questions that I'd like to be able to answer through #datavisualization:

What is the total CO2 emission from 1960 to 2011?
What is the total CO2 per capita?
Which region has the highest production and emission of CO2?
What is the CO2 per capita by region?
Is the production and emission of CO2 increasing or decreasing? 

I used #Tableau for creating, connecting, and data visualization.

I am always open to learning and growing, thus, your feedback is/will be highly appreciated.
